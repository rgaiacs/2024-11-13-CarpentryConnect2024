## Software Carpentry 1.0

::: {.notes}
This is how Software Carpentry started.
:::

> In response, John Reynders (then director of the Advanced Computing Laboratory at Los Alamos National Laboratory) invited the [Greg Wilson] and Brent Gorda (now at Intel) to teach a week-long course to LANL staff. This course ran for the first time in July 1998, and was repeated nine times over the next four years.

### Python

Version [1.5.1](https://github.com/python/cpython/releases/tag/v1.5.1) is the latest release.

Python Package Index (PyPI) has **not** been created, [PyPI was launched in 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Package_Index).

Numeric (now called NumPy) was [announced in 1995](http://hugunin.net/papers/hugunin95numpy.html). matplotlib has **not** been created, [matplotlib first release was in 2003](https://matplotlib.org/stable/project/license.html#copyright-policy).

<!-- SciPy has not been created, [first release around 2001](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10121). -->

### R

Version [0.62.2](https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-0/) is the latest release.

The Comprehensive R Archive Network [(CRAN) was launched the year before (1997)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)).

ggplot (now called ggplot2) has **not** been created, [ggplot first release was in 2006](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/ggplot/).

## Also in July of 1998 ...

Microsoft's [Windows 98 was released the month before (June 1998)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_98).

Apple's [Mac OS 8 was released the year before (1997)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS#Mac_OS_8).

[Concurrent Versions System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System) (CVS) was the most popular version control system.

[The first x86 virtualization product was under development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_virtualization_technologies#1990s) by VMware.

## Back to the Future, or 2012

::: {.notes}
This is when Raniere got involved with Software Carpentry.
:::

> Software Carpentry rebooted again in January 2012 with a grant from the Sloan Foundation to the Mozilla Foundation. This time, the model was two-day intensive workshops like those pioneered by The Hacker Within, a grassroots group of grad students helping grad students at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.

## In 2012 ...

::: {.notes}
This a summary of the software landscape when Software Carpentry rebooted as part of Mozilla Science Lab. This was soon after the first release of IPython Notebook and RStudio IDE.

### Python

Versions [2.7.3](https://github.com/python/cpython/releases/tag/v2.7.3) and [3.1.5](https://github.com/python/cpython/releases/tag/v3.1.5) are the latest releases.

[IPython Notebook (now called Jupyter Notebook) was released the year before (2011)](https://ipython.org/news.html#ipython-0-12).

[Many packages from Python Package Index (PyPI) only work with Python 2.x.y](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Python#Compatibility).
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### R

Version [2.15.0](https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/) is the latest release.

[RStudio IDE was released the year before (2011)](https://posit.co/blog/rstudio-new-open-source-ide-for-r/).

dplyr (and tidyverse) has not been created, [dplyr first release was in 2014](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org//news/index.html#dplyr-011).

## Also in 2012 ...

Microsoft's [Windows 8 was released this year (2012)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_8).

Apple's [OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) was released this year (2012)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS).

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) and [Mercurial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial) were the most popular version control system. [Apache Subversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion) (SVN) had lost a lot of version control system market share.

[GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) replaced [SourceForge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SourceForge) as the hosting platform for open source software source code.

[PEP 427 â€“ The Wheel Binary Package Format 1.0](Application period: Early April - May 15, 2024) was created this year (2012).

[Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) was under development.

## Source Distribution

::: {.notes}
The native package manager for Python and R install new packages from source distribution. Because the package manager gets only the source code, the package manager needs to compile the source code to binary and, because of that, the user's computer needs additional software like GCC.
:::

From [Python Packaging User Guide's Glossary](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Source-Distribution-or-sdist)

> A distribution format [...] that provides metadata and the essential source files needed for installing by a tool [...]

This is a popular option for many package manager, for example, [pip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager)) and [CRAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_package#Comprehensive_R_Archive_Network_(CRAN)).

## Built Distribution

::: {.notes}
To remove the requirement that the user's computer has GCC, some package managers download binaries instead of the source code.
:::

From [Python Packaging User Guide's Glossary](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Built-Distribution)

> A Distribution format containing files and metadata that only need to be moved to the correct location on the target system, to be installed. 

This is a popular option for many package manager, for example, [dpkg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dpkg), [rpm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager), [conda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conda_(package_manager)) and [Posit Package Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_package#MRAN_and_Posit_Package_Manager).

## Unix-like shell in Windows

The options were

- [Cygwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygwin)
- [MinGW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinGW)

  [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) was based on MinGW.
- (Oracle) [VirtualBox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtualBox)

### Limitations

- "Host" file system mapping
- Copy and paste
