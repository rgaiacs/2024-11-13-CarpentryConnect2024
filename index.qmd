## Software Carpentry 1.0

::: {.notes}
This is how Software Carpentry started.
:::

> In response, John Reynders (then director of the Advanced Computing Laboratory at Los Alamos National Laboratory) invited the [Greg Wilson] and Brent Gorda (now at Intel) to teach a week-long course to LANL staff. This course ran for the first time in July 1998, and was repeated nine times over the next four years.

## Back to the Future, or 2012

> Software Carpentry rebooted again in January 2012 with a grant from the Sloan Foundation to the Mozilla Foundation. This time, the model was two-day intensive workshops like those pioneered by The Hacker Within, a grassroots group of grad students helping grad students at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.
