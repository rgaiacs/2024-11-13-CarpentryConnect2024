# Escaping the circles of installation hell

Presentation during [BioNT Community Event & CarpentryConnect - Heidelberg 2024](https://biont-training.eu/CarpentryConnect2024.html).

## Abstract

Since the first Sofware Carpentry workshop in 1998, guaranteeing that the software was installed correctly on the user's computer was a challenge. Every instructor has their personal collection of lessons learnt. Could our instructors, in 2025, be free from the installation hell? In this breakout discussion session we will talk about (1) the use of cloud computing like mybinder.org, Google Colaboratory, and GitHub Codespaces and (2) WebAssembly powered computing like JupyterLite and WebR. If time allows, we will also talk about code execution during a lesson using tools like Thebe and learnr.
