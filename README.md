## Abstract

Since the first Sofware Carpentry workshop in 1998, guarantee that the software was installed correct on the user's computer was a challenge. Every instructors have their personal collection of lessons learnt. In 2025, could our instructors be free from the installation hell? In this breakout discussion session we will talk about (1) the use of cloud computing like mybinder.org, Google Colaboratory, and GitHub Codespaces and (2) WebAssembly powered computing like JupyterLite and WebR. If time allow, we will also talk about code execution from within the lesson using tools like Thebe and learnr.
